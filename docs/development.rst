Development
============

Python version
--------------

* Python 3.8 or later

Builds on github automatically run all tests on Python versions from 3.8 to 3.13.

(human) Language
----------------

All functions, classes, and especially documentation shall be in English.
Use a spell checker.

Coding style
------------

- Style should follow PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/,
  with the following exceptions:

  - all class attributes should be considered private and do not use the "_" prefix.

- Documentation is generated automatically from docstrings, that
  should follow the numpydoc convention:  https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/

Developing guide
----------------

You can contribute to SPECULA using github forks as usual.
